# Documentation

Welcome to the [scp-machine](https://github.com/ostis-ai/scp-machine) documentation! This comprehensive guide is designed to help you navigate the features, functionalities, and applications of scp-machine, a C++ software interpreter of programs in the basic programming language of the [**OSTIS Technology**](https://github.com/ostis-ai).

## What is scp-machine?  

scp-machine is a **software interpreter** designed to execute programs written in the basic programming language of the **OSTIS Technology**. It extends the capabilities of the [**sc-machine**](https://github.com/ostis-ai/sc-machine), which serves as a platform for developing intelligent agents based on knowledge representation and processing. scp-machine interprets programs that are structured as knowledge graphs, utilizing the *SCP (Semantic Code Programming) Language*.
